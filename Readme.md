_I work as a Software Consultant at Netcompany Norway - an international company with more than 2000 employees in 6 countries that provides valuable expertise and experience to help organizations with digital transformation. Currently, they are exploring new fields and ways to automate time-consuming processes using Microsoft cloude services. One of them is to integrate web apps with Microsoft Teams to provide better overview and control of project challenges._

Microsoft Teams is a collaboration app with [13 millions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2019/07/11/microsoft-teams-reaches-13-million-daily-active-users-introduces-4-new-ways-for-teams-to-work-better-together/) active users daily. A hub for teamwork that combines chat, video meetings, calling, and files into a complete integrated app. What makes Microsoft Teams stand out is the flexibility it provides with web apps.

Organizations today can create custom web apps, integrate it with Teams, and, communicate with Microsoft Graph, a Restful API endpoint to interact with Office, OneDrive, SharePoint, Outlook and so on. For instance, a project manager needs to move worked hours for 100 employees from system A to B, imagine the work load; he must create an excel file, add title, add records, and store each file on OneDrive once finished. The time it takes depends, but in general it can take days to complete such work. This is where Microsoft Graph API can become a valuable tool for automating such process. It supports various endpoints for Excel, and many other Microsoft cloud services.

## Outcome

In this article, we'll use Silent Authentication, a authentication flow for tabs that uses OAuth 2.0. It's recommended to have some basic understanding of OAuth 2.0, [here's a good overview](https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified/#single-page-apps). It reduces number of a user needs to enter their login credentials by silently refreshing the authentication token, thus a popup form is hidden when user has signed in. It means a better user experience when using content pages in Teams.

The end-goal of this article is to generate an Excel file and store it on OneDrive, for this to happen we must follow these steps:

**Step 1** - Authenticate user
**Step 2** - Ged access token
**Step 3** - Access Microsoft Graph

> What is Azure Actice Directory (AAD), and why do we need it? In order to secure our data from a unauthorized users, we must ensure two things; they belong to the correct domain (company), and consent to provided access permisions like (User.Read, File.Read).

This article won't cover how to integrate a web application with Microsoft Teams using App Studio. Here's a nice [article](https://medium.com/@paumadregis/custom-microsoft-teams-applications-the-easy-way-6da0a5975336) by PÃ¤r that covers it very well.

## Prerequisites

* Microsoft Teams account
* Office 365 Developer subscription (Required in order to create apps in MS Teams)
* [Register app in App registriations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2) to integrate it with Microsoft identity platform and call Microsoft Graph
* A deployed web application (We've used Netlify)

> Did you know that App Registration in Azure AD offers developers a simple, secure, and flexible way to sign-in and acess Azure resources like Graph API. Additionally, one can grant spesified permissions on each user to preserve a secure system from malicious attacks.

## Installation

1. Microsoft Teams SDK
2. ADAL.js SDK



## Install NPM packages

In order to display the content page and communicate with Teams context such as retreive user details, install Microsoft Teams JavaScript client SDK. Additionally, you also need to install Azure Active Directory Library SDK to perform authentication operations.

The framework we are using in this example is [React with TypeScript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/) to easily create and manage web components, however, if you don't want to use a framework - plain JavaScript works as well. Most examples in Microsoft docs show the authentication process with either plain JavaScript, Angular, or NodeJS.

> Be aware that the underlying authentication flow is generrelly the same out their, but with few differences depending on the framework.


Let us begin with installing these two packages, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install --save adal-angular
npm install --save @microsoft/teams-js
```
> Note: Currently there is one NPM package providing both the plain JS library (adal.js) and the AngularJS wrapper (adal-angular.js). In short, `adal-angular` works fine with plain JavaScript or TypeScript even though the naming consit Angular.

If you are using TypeScript, there is a `@types` package for `adal-angular`. Having types on a package you haven't worked on before is extremely handy, especially when you want to see the abilities/limitations a package offers without needing to open the documentation for every object or method.

```bash
# Only if your using TypeScript
npm install --save @types/adal-angular
```


## Import packages
Once you've installed the NPM packages, the next step is to import these packages in your JS/TS file. The modules we need to import is `AuthenticationContext` for handling authentication calls to Azure AD, and MS Teams to ingerate and display the content page (web app) within the Teams app. Last but not least, if you are using TypeScript, you can go ahead and add the `Option` interface which shows what properties can be added to an object (the example for this will be shown later).

```ts
import AuthenticationContext, { Options } from 'adal-angular';
import * as microsoftTeams from '@microsoft/teams-js';
```

## Initialize Microsoft Teams

Since MS Teams is showing the content page using `iframe` (a nested browsing context) we need to make sure the user is a part of the MS Teams context before running authentication. It means authentication process runs only if the content page is opened within MS Teams. This does neccessarly mean the app is fully secure but ensures that authentication flow only runs for MS Teams users.

In order to use MS Teams services, we must initialize it first:

```ts
microsoftTeams.initialize();
```

This way the content page is displayed in MS Teams through the embedded view context.

## Setup Configuration

Before we setup the configuration object with details (found in overview page in Azure AD) to authenticate the user, we must add the `redirectURI` in the list of redirect URIs for the Azure AD app. Once the user is successfully authenticated, Azure AD validates if `redirectURI` exists, and if the `redirectURI` is not found in Azure AD, the process will fail by returning an error: `The reply url specified in the request does not mach the reply urls configured for the application`.

But how does the authentication flow look when we try to login a user? Here's a basic example that illustrates the authentication flow:


```txt
// 1. Login method is executed

// 2. A popup windows is shown: wait for user credentials
login.microsoft.com?clientId=asdfasdfasdf&redirectUri=domain.com/auth/silent-end

// 3. Login successfull (only if credentials are correct)

// 3. Azured AD sees the request: if the redirect URI is specified, respond with id token in the query string
domain.com/idToken=blablabla
```

Now that we have a basic understanding of the authentication flow, and the relevancy of `redirectURI`, the next step is to setup the `config` object. The information is required for Azure AD to authenticate the user, and redirect user in the right domain with the right token. This information such as `clientID` and `tenant` can be found in the overview page in Azure AD.


```ts
let config: Options = {
    tenant: 'tenant_id', // Can be found in Azure AD
    clientId: 'client_id', // Can be found in Azure AD
    redirectUri: 'URI' + '/auth/silent-end', // Important: URL must be registered in Redirect URL otherwise it won't work.
    cacheLocation: "localStorage",
    popUp: true, // Set this to true to enable login in a pop-up window instead of a full page redirect.
    navigateToLoginRequestUrl: false,
};
```

## 4. Create a configuration context

In order to access methods like `login`, `logout`, `getCachedUser`, `getCachedToken`, `aquireToken` and so on, we need to create an `AutenticationContext` and pass `config` object as argument. This establishes like a communication bridge between the web app and Azure AD for authenticating users.

```ts
let authContext = new AuthenticationContext(config);
```

Now everytime you use `authContext`, it will perform operations based on what is defined in `config` object. This means if your application interacts with various of Azure AD domains, you can setup multiple contexts.

## Check if user is logged in

Once we have created an `AuthenticationContext(config)`, the next step is check if user is cached. Keep in mind that the whole authentication process is done through `MicrosoftTeams.getContext({...auth process goes here...})` to ensure the auth process only runs within MS Teams.


```ts
microsoftTeams.getContext((context) => {
    let user = authContext.getCachedUser();
    if (user) {
        // Code that runs here means the user has been authenticated
        // Get access_token for MS Graph
    } else {
        // Show login popup
        authContext.login();
    }
}
```

As shown above, before we can authenticate the user, we check if the user is cached (already stored in memory). If user is not cached, we invoke the `authContext.login()` method which opens up a popup page that waits for user credentials. Remember to set the popup property to `true` in configs otherwise the popup page won't show. If user has already signed in in MS Teams, the popup page uses that context to automatically sign in the user. It means the popup page will only be visible within 1-2 seconds.

## Handle cache

Once the user has logged in, we cache it to reduce number of authenticate requests to server. Working with cache is always a challenge in terms of refreshing it when it is necessary. Adal.js provides an easy and convinient way to handle cache using with methods like `authContext.getCachedUser()`, `authContext.getCachedToken()`, and 'authContext.clearCache()'.

If the current user is not the same as the one in Teams context, we clear the cache. Doing so, the new user has to login again. The code shown in step 5 will be triggered.

```ts
// Clear cache if expected user is different
if (user.userName !== context.upn) {
    authContext.clearCache();
}
